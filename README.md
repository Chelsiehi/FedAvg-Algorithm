## Introduction

Federated learning allows you to train machine learning models across multiple decentralized clients (devices or servers) while keeping data local, thus addressing privacy concerns. The FedAvg algorithm aggregates model updates from participating clients to create a global model. This repository provides a PyTorch implementation of FedAvg for federated learning scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this implementation, you need:

- Python 3.x
